## Questions & Answers

1. **What is the median engine size in liters?**
    - The average engine size of the cars is 3.0 liters.

2. **What is the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?**
	- The average fuel consumption, per 100km, for each gas type is as follows:
		1. Regular Gas (10.08L)
		2. Premium Gas (11.42L)
		3. Ethanol (16.86L)
		4. Diesel (8.84L)

3. **What is the correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?**
	- The correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is 0.92.
		- This tells us that the correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are quite high, since this mathematical concept is only between -1 to +1.
		- So, when fuel consumption is higher per 100km, the CO2 emissions will also rise with it.

4. **Which vehicle class has lower average CO2 emissions, 'SUV - SMALL' or 'MID-SIZE'?**
	- Between SUV - SMALL and MID-SIZE, MID-SIZE has the lower average CO2 emissions. 236.29 g/km and 222.46 g/km respectively.

5. **What are the average CO2 emissions for all vehicles? For vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller?**
	- The average CO2 emissions for all cars in the dataset is 250.59 g/km.
	- The average CO2 emissions for vehicles with an engine size of 2.0L or smaller is 198.27 g/km.

6. **What is the correlation between Engine Size and CO2 Emissions?**
	- When comparing engine size to CO2 emissions, there was a 0.85 correlation between the two. This wasn't as strong as fuel consumption vs. CO2 emissions, but it is still a very strong correlation.

7. **What are the top five car manufacturers that produce the lowest CO2 emissions on average?**
    - The top five car manufacturers with the lowest average CO2 emissions of all cars:
      1. Smart (151.43 g/km)
      2. Honda (190.22 g/km)
      3. Fiat (192.25 g/km)
      4. Mazda (193.67 g/km)
      5. Mini (196.59 g/km)

8. **What are the top five car manufacturers that produce the highest CO2 emissions on average?**
    - The top five car manufacturers with the highest average CO2 emissions of all cars:
      1. Bugatti (522.00 g/km)
      2. Lamborghini (400.78 g/km)
      3. SRT (389.00 g/km)
      4. Rolls Royce (388.48 g/km)
      5. Bentley (362.93 g/km)

## Overall Review and Recommendations

**With all of the information presented, there are a few ideas for new guidelines on CO2 emission rules.**

1. Since we know the average engine size is 3.0L, and we know that the bigger the engine, the bigger the CO2 footprint, we can start to do an incremental push over the next 10 years to have newer cars producing less CO2 emissions per car. The highest CO2 emissions in our data shows as 522 g/km. The 10 year goal would be to push that number down to a minimum of the 75% of CO2 emissions found in the data, which is 288 g/km. Just for the sake of an even number, we can keep the number at 300 g/km within 10 years. After that, we can revisit how the car industry is doing, and see what we can do from there. With the rise of electric vehicles, we may have to do two studies to see how they are both performing separately, and together.

2. Another idea we could implement is introducing a carbon footprint tax on all cars who's CO2 emissions are above the suggested maximum amount, whether that's a new car or a used one. We should be pushing to have people stear away from these types of cars if we can't do anything else.

3. Cars that consume the most fuel per 100 KM are cars that run on Ethanol and Premium Gas. This could also be taxed higher since they do, on average, consume more liters of fuel per 100 km. We reviewed that this is correlated to the amount of CO2 emissions that are produced by cars. We can start to push for Diesel and Regular Gas powered cars, and even introduce a small rebate for customers and manufacturers who produce and buy Diesel cars, since that is the lowest Fuel Consumption of all gas types.

## Limitations

1. We are unable to see the year each model was made, so we cannot determine if there is a trend for higher or lower CO2 emissions with newer cars.

2. The dataset did not have a large supply of natural gas powered cars, so we are unable to see how they rank on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

3. The dataset did not include anything about electric vehicles, their electricity consumption, and the footprint they are leaving. Electric cars are starting to become a bigger industry, and we need to see the impact they will have on the Earth.
